# PurePythonSearch
A search engine coded from scratch in python

# Objectives
## Learning 
While there are more robust and battle tested search engines like **Lucene** and its popular distributed implementation **ElasticSearch**, the purpose of this project is to learn about and understand the inner working and mechanisms of search engines while experimenting with different text processing algorithms and data structures.


## Job search platform
This search engine will be the starting point of a job matching search engine, where candidates providing their resume / cv / preference will be matched with recent job offers crawled and scraped from popular job posting websites (Linkedin, Indeed, Glassdoor...).
